# Self study & Improvement

I want to outline my study plans to grow in artificial intelligence as an AI engineer. 

This plan is more focused on long term growth with solid understanding of the basics and competence in translating foundational knowledge into clean and professional code. 

### **Goals of the self study plans :**

- Become proficient at Pytorch while implementing the state of art breakthrough in AI.
- Get deep insights and foundational knowledge about NLPs, Transformers, finetuning, LLMs
- Get so familiar with vector databases and RAG ( Retrieval augmented generation)

### **Strategy :**

To be able to achieve the aforementioned goals, a strategy will come with measurable actions and deeds that will be exercised on daily/weekly basis. 

This strategy consists of varying the resources of learning, from courses, tutorials, articles to youtube videos, and personal projects. 

For the 3 upcoming months, I will try to invest 50% of my time in PyTorch Tutorials since I need to get a skill brushing in deep learning and Tensors and code Optimization. 

The other 50% of the time will be devided between youtube video courses ( such as the great tutorials of Andrej Karpathy) and deepLearningAI courses in RAG, vector databases which will consolidate my high level knowledge in NLP and LLMs and self tailored projects that would put my learning to action. 

**Special Cases :** 

Preparing for a technical interview might need that I change the strategy a bit depending on the requirements of that interview, of example I speed up in information gathering to be ready to discuss more broader topics and respond to more varied questions

If everything works well in these 3 months, I might incorporate more in depth learning from deep learning books that covers more mathematics and in depth foundational background. 

**Remarks :** 

Pytorch Tutorials : not always obvious what to tutorial to take, it needs most of the time research to know what’s the next step. I might use an AI assistant to help me figure out what I exactly need in each moment.

Defining an estimated weekly target is important to be able to track how far I could have progressed. Also a weekly report to see what was achieved and what not and what might have been the issues to be adjusted in the next weeks.

**Current schedule and interview/coding test prep :**

On a daily basis, I think working on my personal project in the morning for about **an 1 hour.** Dive in Pytorch for **1 hour.** If possible I would try to get a course tutorial for **1 hour** done as well in the morning/ evening. Otherwise, we keep it at night after work.
