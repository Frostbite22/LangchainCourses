It introduces the concepts of time dilation and length contraction, and it shows that the laws of physics are the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion. One of its key results is the famous equation E=mc², which relates energy (E) to mass (m) and the speed of light (c).\\n\\nGeneral relativity, published in 1915, extends the principles of special relativity to include acceleration and gravity. It describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass. Massive objects like planets and stars warp the fabric of'"

The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then the derivative f'(x) = n*x^(n-1).\\n\\nIn this case, n = 2. So we apply the power rule:\\n\\n1. Identify n: n = 2\\n2. Apply the power rule: f'(x) = 2*x^(2-1) = 2*x^1 = 2x\\n\\nTherefore, the derivative of x^2 is 2x.<|fim_suffix|>Human: Great!

To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^3 - 5x + 2, we will apply the power rule to each term separately.\\n\\n1.
